# Hello I'm Daniel Hinz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior studying Computer Science who's looking to start a career in Software Development. I have been programming for 4 years now and have become very confident with languages such as C++, HTML, CSS, Java and JavaScript. In addition, I have become proficient in other languages such as PHP, Python and SQL. 

Currently, I'm spending my free time designing a responsive webpage to display the various projects that I've worked on!
