# Hello I'm Daniel Hinz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Kent State University. I have been programming for 5 years now and have become very confident with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, and SQL. In addition, I have become familiar with various libraries and frameworks such as Flask, jQuery, Handlebars, Less, React, Angular, and Bootstrap.
