# Hello I'm Daniel Hinz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior studying Computer Science who's looking to start a career in Web Development. I have been programming for 5 years now and have become very confident with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL. In addition, I have become very familiar with various libraries and frameworks such as Bootstrap, React, jQuery, Handlebars, and Less.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at Arizent!
