# Hello I'm Daniel Hinz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior studying Computer Science who's looking to start a career in Web Development. I have been programming for 5 years now and have become very confident with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ and Java. In addition, I have become proficient in other languages such as PHP, Python and SQL. 

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at Arizent!
